However, as you write your documentation, you may reach a point where some small adjustments are necessary to preserve your brand's style. Adding assets \u00b6 MkDocs provides several ways to interfere with themes. In order to make a few tweaks to an existing theme, you can just add your stylesheets and JavaScript files to the docs directory. Additional stylesheets \u00b6 If you want to tweak some colors or change the spacing of certain elements, you can do this in a separate stylesheet. The easiest way is by creating a new stylesheet file in your docs directory: mkdir docs/stylesheets touch docs/stylesheets/extra.css Then, add the following line to your mkdocs.yml : extra_css : - stylesheets/extra.css Spin up the development server with mkdocs serve and start typing your changes in your additional stylesheet file \u2013 you can see them instantly after saving, as the MkDocs development server supports live reloading. Additional JavaScript \u00b6 The same is true for additional JavaScript. If you want to integrate another syntax highlighter or add some custom logic to your theme, create a new JavaScript file in your docs directory: mkdir docs/javascripts touch docs/javascripts/extra.js Then, add the following line to your mkdocs.yml : extra_javascript : - javascripts/extra.js Further assistance can be found in the MkDocs documentation . Extending the theme \u00b6 If you want to alter the HTML source (e.g. add or remove some part), you can extend the theme. MkDocs supports theme extension , an easy way to override parts of a theme without forking and changing the main theme. Setup and theme structure \u00b6 Reference the Material theme as usual in your mkdocs.yml , and create a new folder for overrides which you reference using custom_dir : theme : name : material custom_dir : overrides Theme extension prerequisites As the custom_dir variable is used for the theme extension process, the Material for MkDocs needs to be installed via pip and referenced with the name parameter in your mkdocs.yml . The structure in the overrides directory must mirror the directory structure of the original theme, as any file in the overrides directory will replace the file with the same name which is part of the original theme. Besides, further assets may also be put in the overrides directory. The directory layout of the theme is as follows: . \u251c\u2500 assets/ \u2502 \u251c\u2500 images/ # Images and icons \u2502 \u251c\u2500 javascripts/ # JavaScript \u2502 \u2514\u2500 stylesheets/ # Stylesheets \u251c\u2500 partials/ \u2502 \u251c\u2500 integrations/ # 3rd-party integrations \u2502 \u251c\u2500 language/ # Localized languages \u2502 \u251c\u2500 footer.html # Footer bar \u2502 \u251c\u2500 header.html # Header bar \u2502 \u251c\u2500 hero.html # Hero teaser \u2502 \u251c\u2500 language.html # Localized labels \u2502 \u251c\u2500 nav-item.html # Main navigation item \u2502 \u251c\u2500 nav.html # Main navigation \u2502 \u251c\u2500 search.html # Search box \u2502 \u251c\u2500 social.html # Social links \u2502 \u251c\u2500 source-date.html # Last updated date \u2502 \u251c\u2500 source-link.html # Link to source file \u2502 \u251c\u2500 source.html # Repository information \u2502 \u251c\u2500 tabs-item.html # Tabs navigation item \u2502 \u251c\u2500 tabs.html # Tabs navigation \u2502 \u251c\u2500 toc-item.html # Table of contents item \u2502 \u2514\u2500 toc.html # Table of contents \u251c\u2500 404 .html # 404 error page \u251c\u2500 base.html # Base template \u2514\u2500 main.html # Default page Overriding partials \u00b6 In order to override the footer, we can replace the footer.html partial with our own partial. To do this, create the file partials/footer.html in the overrides directory. MkDocs will now use the new partial when rendering the theme. This can be done with any file. Overriding template blocks \u00b6 Besides overriding partials, one can also override so called template blocks , which are defined inside the templates and wrap specific features. To override a template block, create a main.html inside the overrides directory and define the block, e.g.: {% extends \"base.html\" %} {% block htmltitle %} <title>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet</title> {% endblock %} Material for MkDocs provides the following template blocks: Block name Wrapped contents analytics Wraps the Google Analytics integration announce Wraps the Announcement bar config Wraps the JavaScript application config content Wraps the main content disqus Wraps the disqus integration extrahead Empty block to define additional meta tags fonts Wraps the webfont definitions footer Wraps the footer with navigation and copyright header Wraps the fixed header bar hero Wraps the hero teaser (if available) htmltitle Wraps the <title> tag libs Wraps the JavaScript libraries (header) scripts Wraps the JavaScript application (footer) source Wraps the linked source files site_meta Wraps the meta tags in the document head site_nav Wraps the site navigation and table of contents styles Wraps the stylesheets (also extra sources) tabs Wraps the tabs navigation (if available) For more on this topic refer to the MkDocs documentation Theme development \u00b6 Material for MkDocs uses Webpack as a build tool to leverage modern web technologies like TypeScript and SASS . If you want to make more fundamental changes, it may be necessary to make the adjustments directly in the source of the theme and recompile it. This is fairly easy. Environment setup \u00b6 In order to start development on Material for MkDocs, a Node.js version of at least 12 is required. First, clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material Next, all dependencies need to be installed, which is done with: cd mkdocs-material pip install -r requirements.txt npm install Development mode \u00b6 Start the Webpack watchdog with: npm start Then, in a second session, start the MkDocs server with: mkdocs serve Point your browser to localhost:8000 and you should see this documentation in front of you. Automatically generated files Never make any changes in the material directory, as the contents of this directory are automatically generated from the src directory and will be overridden when the theme is built. Build process \u00b6 When you've finished making your changes, you can build the theme by invoking: npm run build This triggers the production-level compilation and minification of all stylesheets and JavaScript sources. When the command exits, the final files are located in the material directory. Add the theme_dir variable pointing to the aforementioned directory in your original mkdocs.yml . Now you can run mkdocs build and you should see your documentation with your changes to the original theme.","title":"Appetizers"},{"location":"appetizers/#customization","text":"","title":"Customization"},{"location":"appetizers/#a-great-starting-point","text":"Project documentation is as diverse as the projects themselves and Material for MkDocs is a good starting point for making it look great.

Found a bug? \u00b6 If you found a bug in the source code, you can help us by submitting an issue to the issue tracker in our GitHub repository. Even better, you can submit a Pull Request with a fix. However, before doing so, please read the submission guidelines . Missing a feature? \u00b6 You can request a new feature by submitting an issue to our GitHub Repository. If you would like to implement a new feature, please submit an issue with a proposal for your work first, to be sure that it is of use for everyone, as the Material for MkDocs is highly opinionated. Please consider what kind of change it is: For a major feature , first open an issue and outline your proposal so that it can be discussed. This will also allow us to better coordinate our efforts, prevent duplication of work, and help you to craft the change so that it is successfully accepted into the project. Small features and bugs can be crafted and directly submitted as a Pull Request. However, there is no guarantee that your feature will make it into the master , as it's always a matter of opinion whether if benefits the overall functionality of the project. Submission guidelines \u00b6 Submitting an issue \u00b6 Before you submit an issue, please search the issue tracker, maybe an issue for your problem already exists and the discussion might inform you of workarounds readily available. We want to fix all the issues as soon as possible, but before fixing a bug we need to reproduce and confirm it. In order to reproduce bugs we will systematically ask you to provide a minimal reproduction scenario using the custom issue template. Please stick to the issue template. Unfortunately we are not able to investigate / fix bugs without a minimal reproduction scenario, so if we don't hear back from you we may close the issue. Submitting a Pull Request (PR) \u00b6 Search GitHub for an open or closed PR that relates to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort. If you do not find a related issue or PR, go ahead. Development : Fork the project, set up the development environment , make your changes in a separate git branch and add descriptive messages to your commits. Build : Before submitting a pull requests, build the theme . This is a mandatory requirement for your PR to get accepted, as the theme should at all times be installable through GitHub. Pull Request : After building the theme, commit the compiled output, push your branch to GitHub and send a PR to mkdocs-material:master . If we suggest changes, make the required updates, rebase your branch and push the changes to your GitHub repository, which will automatically update your PR. After your PR is merged, you can safely delete your branch and pull the changes from the main (upstream) repository.","title":"Salads"},{"location":"salads/#contributing","text":"Interested in contributing to the Material for MkDocs?

A compatible version is always included with the theme. Configuration \u00b6 The following list of extensions that are part of the PyMdown Extensions package are recommended to be used together with Material for MkDocs: markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.arithmatex - pymdownx.betterem : smart_enable : all - pymdownx.caret - pymdownx.critic - pymdownx.details - pymdownx.emoji : emoji_index : !!python/name:materialx.emoji.twemoji emoji_generator : !!python/name:materialx.emoji.to_svg - pymdownx.inlinehilite - pymdownx.magiclink - pymdownx.mark - pymdownx.smartsymbols - pymdownx.superfences - pymdownx.tasklist : custom_checkbox : true - pymdownx.tabbed - pymdownx.tilde Usage \u00b6 Arithmatex MathJax \u00b6 Arithmatex integrates Material for MkDocs with MathJax which parses block-style and inline equations written in TeX markup and outputs them in mathematical notation. See this thread for a short introduction and quick reference on how to write equations in TeX syntax. Besides activating the extension in the mkdocs.yml , the MathJax JavaScript runtime needs to be included. This can be done with additional JavaScript : extra_javascript : - https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.0/MathJax.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML If you want to override the default MathJax configuration, you can do this by adding another JavaScript file before the MathJax runtime which contains the MathJax configuration, e.g.: window . MathJax = { tex2jax : { inlineMath : [ [ \"\\\\(\" , \"\\\\)\" ] ], displayMath : [ [ \"\\\\[\" , \"\\\\]\" ] ] }, TeX : { TagSide : \"right\" , TagIndent : \".8em\" , MultLineWidth : \"85%\" , equationNumbers : { autoNumber : \"AMS\" , }, unicode : { fonts : \"STIXGeneral,'Arial Unicode MS'\" } }, displayAlign : \"left\" , showProcessingMessages : false , messageStyle : \"none\" }; Then, add the following lines to mkdocs.yml : extra_javascript : - javascripts/extra.js - https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.0/MathJax.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML Blocks \u00b6 Blocks are enclosed in $$ ... $$ which are placed on separate lines. Example: $$ \\frac {n ! }{k !( n - k )! } = \\binom {n}{k} $$ Result: \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} = \\binom{n}{k} \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} = \\binom{n}{k} Inline \u00b6 Inline equations must be enclosed in $ ... $ : Example: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet: $ p ( x|y ) = \\frac {p ( y|x ) p ( x ) }{p ( y ) } $ Result: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet: p(x|y) = \\frac{p(y|x)p(x)}{p(y)} p(x|y) = \\frac{p(y|x)p(x)}{p(y)} BetterEm \u00b6 BetterEm improves the handling of emphasis markup ( bold and italic ) within Markdown by providing a more sophisticated parser for better detecting start and end tokens. Read the documentation for usage notes . Caret \u00b6 Caret makes it possible to highlight inserted text . The portion of text that should be marked as added must be enclosed in two carets ^^...^^ . Critic \u00b6 Critic implements Critic Markup , a Markdown extension that enables the tracking of changes (additions, deletions and comments) on documents. During compilation of the Markdown document, changes can be rendered (default), accepted or rejected. Text can be deleted and replacement text added . This can also be combined into one a single operation. Highlighting is also possible and comments can be added inline . Formatting can also be applied to blocks, by putting the opening and closing tags on separate lines and adding new lines between the tags and the content. Details \u00b6 Details adds collapsible Admonition blocks which can contain arbitrary content using the HTML5 details and summary tags. Additionally, all Admonition qualifiers can be used, e.g. note , question , warning etc.: How many Prolog programmers does it take to change a lightbulb? Yes. Emoji \u00b6 Emoji adds the ability to insert, well, emojis! By default, Emoji uses JoyPixles' emoji under the former name EmojiOne. Recent versions of the extension lock support to an older version (2.2.7) due to JoyPixels' newer, less permissible licenses included in later releases. This restricts support to Unicode 9. To get the latest support for the current Unicode version, you can use Twemoji instead which has a much more permissible license. Simply override the default emoji index being used: markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.emoji : emoji_index : !!python/name:pymdownx.emoji.twemoji emoji_generator : !!python/name:pymdownx.emoji.to_svg To view all the available short names and emoji available, see Emoji's documentation on your chosen index which includes links to the files containing the short names and emoji associated with each supported index. Legal disclaimer Material has no affiliation with JoyPixles or Twemoji , both of which are licensed under CC BY 4.0 . When including images or CSS from either provider, please read their licenses to ensure proper attribution: EmojiOne or Twemoji . Icons \u00b6 In addition, you can embed the Material Design icons, Fontawesome icons and GitHub's Octicons directly from Markdown by using Material for MkDocs's custom emoji index . It extends the Twemoji index with new short names that access any of the included icons. To use the custom index, you need to use materialx.emoji instead of pymdownx.emoji : markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.emoji : emoji_index : !!python/name:materialx.emoji.twemoji emoji_generator : !!python/name:materialx.emoji.to_svg Example: * :material-account-circle: \u2013 we can use Material Design icons * :fontawesome-regular-laugh-wink: \u2013 we can also use FontAwesome icons * :octicons-octoface: \u2013 that's not all, we can also use GitHub's Octicons Result: \u2013 we can use Material Design icons \u2013 we can also use FontAwesome icons \u2013 that's not all, we can also use GitHub's Octicons InlineHilite \u00b6 InlineHilite adds support for inline code highlighting. It's useful for short snippets included within body copy, e.g. var test = 0 ; and can be activated by prefixing inline code with a shebang and language identifier, e.g. #!js . MagicLink \u00b6 MagicLink detects links in Markdown and auto-generates the necessary markup, so no special syntax is required. It auto-links http[s]:// and ftp:// links, as well as references to email addresses. Mark \u00b6 Mark adds the ability to highlight text like it was marked with a text marker . The portion of text that should be highlighted must be enclosed in two equal signs ==...== . SmartSymbols \u00b6 SmartSymbols converts markup for special characters into their corresponding symbols, e.g. arrows (\u2190, \u2192, \u2194), trademark and copyright symbols (\u00a9, \u2122, \u00ae) and fractions (\u00bd, \u00bc, ...). SuperFences \u00b6 SuperFences provides the ability to nest code blocks under blockquotes, lists and other block elements, which the Fenced Code Blocks extension from the standard Markdown library doesn't parse correctly. SuperFences does also allow grouping code blocks with tabs . Tabbed \u00b6 Tabbed adds support for creating tabbed groups of Markdown content. Example: === \"Fruit List\" - :apple: Apple - :banana: Banana - :kiwi: Kiwi === \"Fruit Table\" Fruit | Color --------------- | ----- :apple: Apple | Red :banana: Banana | Yellow :kiwi: Kiwi | Green Result: Fruit List Apple Banana Kiwi Fruit Table Fruit Color Apple Red Banana Yellow Kiwi Green Tasklist \u00b6 Tasklist adds support for styled checkbox lists. This is useful for keeping track of tasks and showing what has been done and has yet to be done. Checkbox lists are like regular lists, but prefixed with [ ] for empty or [x] for filled checkboxes. Example: * [x] Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit * [x] Nulla lobortis egestas semper * [x] Curabitur elit nibh, euismod et ullamcorper at, iaculis feugiat est * [ ] Vestibulum convallis sit amet nisi a tincidunt * [x] In hac habitasse platea dictumst * [x] In scelerisque nibh non dolor mollis congue sed et metus * [x] Sed egestas felis quis elit dapibus, ac aliquet turpis mattis * [ ] Praesent sed risus massa * [ ] Aenean pretium efficitur erat, donec pharetra, ligula non scelerisque * [ ] Nulla vel eros venenatis, imperdiet enim id, faucibus nisi Result: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit Nulla lobortis egestas semper Curabitur elit nibh, euismod et ullamcorper at, iaculis feugiat est Vestibulum convallis sit amet nisi a tincidunt In hac habitasse platea dictumst In scelerisque nibh non dolor mollis congue sed et metus Sed egestas felis quis elit dapibus, ac aliquet turpis mattis Praesent sed risus massa Aenean pretium efficitur erat, donec pharetra, ligula non scelerisque Nulla vel eros venenatis, imperdiet enim id, faucibus nisi Tilde \u00b6 Tilde provides an easy way to strike through cross out text. The portion of text that should be erased must be enclosed in two tildes ~~...~~ and the extension will take care of the rest.","title":"Summer 2020"},{"location":"summer2020/ingredients/#pymdown-extensions","text":"PyMdown Extensions is a collection of Markdown extensions that add some great missing features to the standard Markdown library.
