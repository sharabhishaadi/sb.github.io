In fact, he is the inspiration behind this cake. I only made it because he gave me crap for using part of a coconut milk can to make shrimp curry and would not shut his stupid trap until I had used the rest of it. To be honest, the only reason I considered a tres leches cake was because it seemed like a nice and easy party cake to share with a group and my ego would not let me send my husband to work on his 30 th birthday with a store-bought cake Ingredients For the cake and soaking syrup 1.5 cups all purpose flour 1 cup sugar 1 tsp baking powder 0.5 cup unsalted butter, softened and at room temperature 5 eggs (at room temperature) 0.5 tsp vanilla extract 1 (14 oz) can sweetened condensed milk 1 (12 oz) can evaporated milk 1 cup whole milk 1 cup coconut milk For a regular tres leches (skip the coconut milk and use 2 cups of whole milk) Ingredients For the topping 1.5 cup heavy whipping cream 1 cup sugar 1 tsp vanilla extract Apparatus Oven 9\" x 13\" baking pan Procedure Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F and grease the baking pan Cream the butter and sugar until fluffy. Add the eggs one by one and beat well. Add vanilla extract and continue beating Add the sifted flour and baking powder to the above mixture in 4-5 portions and mix well until blended Pour the batter into the pan and bake for 30 mins in the preheated oven. Once the cake is cooled, poke some holes in it using a fork. Combine the condensed milk, evaporated milk, coconut milk and whole milk and pour the mixture over the cake. Wait till the mixture is completely absorbed in the cake. Preferably keep it in the fridge overnight (6-8 hours) Make the topping by whipping together the cream, sugar and vanilla, until the mixture is stiff. Spread over the cake. Photos Hacks and Pro-tips Make sure the eggs are at room temperature. If you use them straight out of the fridge, they cool down the butter mixture, causing little clumps of butter to form, as opposed to a fluffy mix You can help the mixture soak in by lifting the edges of the cake so that the milk can get under the cake","title":"Desserts"},{"location":"desserts/#desserts","text":"","title":"Desserts"},{"location":"desserts/#coconutregular-tres-leches-cake","text":"Writeup I made this cake for my ungrateful and whiny husband not once but three times, while 6 months pregnant.

Sardines are not the most sought after fish and recipes incorporating sardines are likely not on your list of things to try. My husband was the same, until he discovered this recipe which he now swears by. The otherwise overpowering flavor, aroma and texture of these oily fish is comfortably subdued by the sweetness offered by the charred sweet peppers and sherry vinegar that this recipe calls for. More importantly, sardines offer a fabulous balance of Omega-3 and Omega-6 fatty acids and this recipe is a great delivery vehicle to capitalize on a food that can often be a turnoff for many. Ingredients 1 tin of Sardines in Olive Oil (3 sardines per tin) 1 Romaine Lettuce 6-8 Sweet multi-colored mini-peppers 1 Tbsp Capers in Brine (optional) 1 Tbsp Sherry Vinegar \u00bd cup chopped parsley 1 tsp smoked paprika 1 tsp Salt 1 tsp Pepper 3 Tbsp Olive Oil Apparatus Mixing Bowl Coal and BBQ Grill Clingwrap Procedure On a BBQ grill, roast the mini peppers for a few minutes while turning them often such that the peppers are well charred. Once charred, remove the peppers from the grill and place them in the mixing bowl. Seal the mixing bowl with clingfilm and leave for 15 minutes. Roughly chop the lettuce. Triangles are my favorite shape! Take the clingfilm off. Place the peppers on a chopping board and gently peel away 75% of the charred bits. Chop the peeled peppers and put them back in the mixing bowl. Add in about 2 Tbsp of the olive oil and a tsp of paprika, salt and pepper to the mixing bowl Next add about 1 tbsp of the sherry vinegar Add in about a tbsp of capers along with the brine. Next add the chopped parsley. Add in the romaine lettuce Lastly, open the tin of sardines carefully. Split each sardine down the length and remove the spine. Slice each half sardine into three such that in total you have 18 small pieces of the fish. Add the sardines into the bowl and gently toss. Top off with some extra virgin olive oil Hacks and Pro-tips Covering the peppers with clingfilm post BBQ allows the freshly grilled peppers to release steam through their skins making the peepling of the char much easier. If you don't have a grill and the coal, forget the BBQ. Instead purchase canned versions of fire-roasted peppers. They work just as well but be warned - skipping the BBQ is less satisfying to the soul. For a bit of heat and tanginess in this salad, add in some banana-peppers or pperoncini.","title":"Salads"},{"location":"salads/#salads","text":"","title":"Salads"},{"location":"salads/#canned-sardines-fire-roasted-red-peppers","text":"Writeup This is a LCHF/Keto friendly recipe that my husband discovered on youtube .

They were a beautiful deep red colour and just the right size. They weren\u2019t all perfectly ripe when I picked them; their flavor bounced between tart and sweet. While I would have easily consumed them like popcorn, I thought this would be a good opportunity to try my hand at jam making. Plums are high in pectin so it seemed like a pretty easy recipe involving just plums and sugar, without the need for an extraneous pectin-like thickner. It was a simple process in theory but removing the pits from the plums took long since many were quite firm. I pressure-cooked them for 15 minutes and then continued cooking them without the pressure-cooker whistle to further reduce the sauce. This two step process was just enough the soften the plums and turn them into a puree. The jam by itself tasted nice but it lacked depth so I rummaged around in the spice cabinet and finally settled on freshly ground black pepper, which added the nice kick to it. My favourite way to enjoy this jam is to spread it on toast along with some rich creamy cheese like mascarpone. Ingredients 6 lbs of plums 2 cups of sugar 1-2 tbsp of freshly ground black pepper Apparatus Pressure Cooker OR Open Vessel Mason Jars Procedure Cut the plums and remove the pits. There is no need to peel them. Add the sugar to the plums, stir well and let it sit for an hour until you see the juices release from the plums. Cook in a pressure cooker (or in an open vessel) until the plums are soft and the mixture has the consistency of a thick sauce. Add the freshly ground pepper 1 tbsp at a time. Taste the mixture before you add more black pepper as it can make the jam too spicy. Strain the jam to remove the small chunks of plum that might be in the mixture (I did). Transfer the mixture to clean, dry glass jars and let it cool at room temperature. Once it is cooled, store it in the refrigerator.
