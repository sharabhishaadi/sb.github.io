Sardines are not the most sought after fish and recipes incorporating sardines are likely not on your list of things to try. My husband was the same, until he discovered this recipe which he now swears by. The otherwise overpowering flavor, aroma and texture of these oily fish is comfortably subdued by the sweetness offered by the charred sweet peppers and sherry vinegar that this recipe calls for. More importantly, sardines offer a fabulous balance of Omega-3 and Omega-6 fatty acids and this recipe is a great delivery vehicle to capitalize on a food that can often be a turnoff for many. Ingredients 1 tin of Sardines in Olive Oil (3 sardines per tin) 1 Romaine Lettuce 6-8 Sweet multi-colored mini-peppers 1 Tbsp Capers in Brine (optional) 1 Tbsp Sherry Vinegar \u00bd cup chopped parsley 1 tsp smoked paprika 1 tsp Salt 1 tsp Pepper 3 Tbsp Olive Oil Apparatus Mixing Bowl Coal and BBQ Grill Clingwrap Procedure On a BBQ grill, roast the mini peppers for a few minutes while turning them often such that the peppers are well charred. Once charred, remove the peppers from the grill and place them in the mixing bowl. Seal the mixing bowl with clingfilm and leave for 15 minutes. Roughly chop the lettuce. Triangles are my favorite shape! Take the clingfilm off. Place the peppers on a chopping board and gently peel away 75% of the charred bits. Chop the peeled peppers and put them back in the mixing bowl. Add in about 2 Tbsp of the olive oil and a tsp of paprika, salt and pepper to the mixing bowl Next add about 1 tbsp of the sherry vinegar Add in about a tbsp of capers along with the brine. Next add the chopped parsley. Add in the romaine lettuce Lastly, open the tin of sardines carefully. Split each sardine down the length and remove the spine. Slice each half sardine into three such that in total you have 18 small pieces of the fish. Add the sardines into the bowl and gently toss. Top off with some extra virgin olive oil Photos photo 1 link photo 2 link Hacks and Pro-tips Covering the peppers with clingfilm post BBQ allows the freshly grilled peppers to release steam through their skins making the peepling of the char much easier. If you don't have a grill and the coal, forget the BBQ. Instead purchase canned versions of fire-roasted peppers. They work just as well but be warned - skipping the BBQ is less satisfying to the soul. For a bit of heat and tanginess in this salad, add in some banana-peppers or pperoncini.","title":"Salads"},{"location":"salads/#salads","text":"","title":"Salads"},{"location":"salads/#canned-sardines-fire-roasted-red-peppers","text":"Writeup This is a LCHF/Keto friendly recipe that my husband discovered on youtube .
